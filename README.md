Implement two different algorithms in Python to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Your implementations should seek to obtain the best TSP tours that you can, given 10 collections of cities and their city-to-city distances. You will need the following items:
* between 2 and 4 correct Python programs comprising of:
  * at least a basic implementation of each of your chosen algorithms; and
  * possibly an enhanced implementation of each of your chosen algorithms 
* for each of the two chosen algorithms that you implement, 10 tours, one for each city set, detailing the best tours you have found with any implementation of that algorithm, basic or enhanced;
* a one-page proforma (a pdf document) that briefly describes the enhancements you have made in your enhanced implementations, in comparison to the basic implementations.
